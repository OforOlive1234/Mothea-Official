            <p class="paragraph">
                We settle in certain pockets of <strong>undisclosed territory</strong> somewhere on Earth. At this stage, you  probably won't have found us unless we invited you here in real life so an exact location is not necessary. If you are interested, refer to some of our leaders and we shall gladly show you around <strong>Mothea</strong>.
